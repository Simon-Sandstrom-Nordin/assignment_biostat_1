The calibration plot indicates that the model:
Overestimates risk for low-risk patients.
Is well-calibrated for moderate-risk patients.
Underestimates risk for high-risk patients.

Model Refinement:
Address Calibration Issues: Investigate recalibration techniques, such as re-fitting the model or applying a calibration adjustment to the predicted probabilities.
Consider Nonlinear Relationships: Techniques like Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) or polynomial terms may capture complex relationships between predictors and CHD risk.
Interpretation
Low-Risk Groups (Predicted probabilities 0.0–0.2):
The black line is below the red dashed line, indicating that the model is overestimating the risk for low-risk groups.
Clinical Implication: Patients with low predicted probabilities are assigned higher risks than what is observed in reality. This may lead to unnecessary concern or interventions for individuals who are genuinely low-risk.
Moderate-Risk Groups (Predicted probabilities ~0.3–0.5):
The black line aligns closely with the red dashed line, suggesting that the model is well-calibrated for moderate-risk groups.
Clinical Implication: In this range, the model's predictions accurately reflect observed outcomes, making it reliable for guiding decisions for individuals with moderate predicted risks.
High-Risk Groups (Predicted probabilities above ~0.5):
The black line is above the red dashed line, indicating that the model is underestimating the risk for high-risk groups.
Clinical Implication: Patients with high predicted probabilities are assigned lower risks than what is observed in reality. This may result in missed opportunities for preventive or therapeutic interventions for those at high risk.
